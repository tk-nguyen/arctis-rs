# arctis-rs
A small utility to query your Arctis device battery level, written in Rust.
The SteelSeries Engine does not show the battery level in numbers, only the icon so I wrote this to get more details. Also to practice my Rust ðŸ˜€.

## Features
Only getting battery level for now. Maybe I'll add more features in the future? Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯â€‹ 

## Downloads
Head to the release. At the moment only Windows binaries are available.

## Run
Just double click on the binary to run it. Alternatively, run from a terminal window.

## Contribute 
If you want to contribute to this, it's really simple.
First, download rust from https://rustup.rs/ (If you're on Windows you have to install the VS Build Tools too, the installer will tell you how)
Then, clone this repository and build with `cargo`: `cargo build`
Run the program with `cargo run`
If you have any problem, please report it in the issues! I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible
