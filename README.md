# arctis-rs
A small utility to query your Arctis device battery level, written in Rust.

The SteelSeries Engine does not show the battery level in numbers, only the icon so I wrote this to get more details. Also to practice my Rust ðŸ˜€.

## Features
Only getting battery level for now. Maybe I'll add more features in the future? Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯â€‹ 

## Downloads
Head to the release. At the moment only Windows binaries are available.

## Usage
Run the program from a terminal window.
Here's the help options:

```bash
